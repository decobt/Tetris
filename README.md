# Tetris

The 80's famous game remade using the power of React Native. The goal is to get a high score by moving every one of the 5 Tetis shapes, so they structure a strong even line without holes. When such a line is formed, it vanishes and any squares above it tumble down to occupy the empty space. You are rewarded 10 points for each formed line.
