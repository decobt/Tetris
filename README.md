# Tetris

The 80's famous game remade using the power of React Native. The goal is to get a high score by moving every one of the 5 Tetis shapes, so they structure a strong even line without holes. When such a line is formed, it vanishes and any squares above it tumble down to occupy the empty space. You are rewarded 10 points for each formed line.

### Play rules

The rules are just like the classical Tetris Game. There are 4 buttons which you can use to control/navigate the game. You use *left arrow* button to move left,  *right arrow* button to move right and *rotate arrow* button to rotate a shape. If you want to pause the game, just press *play* button.
